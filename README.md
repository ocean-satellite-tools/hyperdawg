You can work with the notebooks (.ipynb) in the JupyterHub.

We have 2 JupyterHubs.
* https://noaa.nmfs-openscapes.2i2c.cloud/ You can log into this one with your NOAA CAC but it has no persistent files.
* https://nmfs-openscapes.2i2c.cloud/ This one has a persistent user directory. Use this if you are using the hub regularly and want your files to stay around. [Request Access (NOAA only)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfa2V3xmZnLaQJULSamAEdkhqSMWKwYWU7il5QXrBWVKkYNFA/viewform)
